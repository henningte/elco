Description: elco provides functions to read in raw data on element contents
    from X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thermal element analysis (TEA), and isotope ratio
    mass spectromtery (IRMS), handling these as data.frames with units, and
    computing simple derived variables, such as element ratios.

<!-- badges: end -->

elco provides functions to handle and (rudimentary) analyse element content data and isotope signatur data. Fetures are:

1. **Import of XRF and IRMS data** as they can be exported from ... and X-ray fluorescence spectrometers (Rigaku ZSX Primus II).

2. Graphical display for easy **data checking**.

3. **Correction of IRMS-measured element content data and isotope signatures** in cases of a mismatch in the signal areas between samples and standards.

4. **Unit conversion** of element content data (e.g. g/g to mol).

5. Computation of the **nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC), oxidative ratio (OR), and degree of unsaturation (DU)** [@Worrall.2016b].

### How to use

Examples will be provided here as soon as sample data is available.

Further information can be found in the vignettes:

+ [Reformatting and checking raw data (csv files) from the X-ray fluorescence device (ZSX Primus II, Rigaku)](vignettes/v001-xrf.Rmd)

+ [Importing and Manipulating IRMS data](vignettes/v002-irms-functions.Rmd)

+ [Computation with element contents - unit conversion, element ratios, nominal oxidation state of carbon, oxidative ratio, and degree of unsaturation](vignettes/v004-element-ratios.Rmd)
